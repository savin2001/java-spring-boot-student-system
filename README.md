## Java Spring Boot Student Application project

This is a demo project to help me understand making a REST-full back-end application using JSB. 
The application connects to MySQL database.

It covers the understanding of the following concepts:
1. Separating the application into its components.
2. API definition and implementation.
3. Service layer definition and dependency injection.
